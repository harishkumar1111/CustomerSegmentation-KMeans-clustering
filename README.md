# CustomerSegmentation-KMeans-clustering
Customer Segmentation for Online Retail Store

our main objective is to cluster the customers of the online store. So, we need to transform this order-wise data into customer-wise data by finding key attributes that best characterises a customer. This is achieved through RFM analysis.
RFM analysis
In RFM analysis, we look at the recency, frequency and the monetary scores of all the customers for segmentation.
Recency: It measures how recently customer visited the store or made a purchase
Frequency: It measures the frequency of the transactions the customers made
Monetary: It measures how much the customer spent on purchases he/she made
So, our target is to compute the RFM numbers for each customer, which effectively means that the granularity level of your data set will change from Invoice number to the CustomerID. Thus, we will have one unique row corresponding to each customer.
Apply K-means algorithm to make different cluster based on RFM analysis.
